# Pyomo2h5

A Python library for efficiently saving **Pyomo models, results, and optimization components** to **HDF5 format**.  
It provides utilities to handle Pyomo variables, expressions, parameters, and constraints, ensuring they are saved in a structured and accessible manner.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Save Pyomo models and results to HDF5 format with hierarchical structure  
- Handle Pyomo components such as **Sets, Parameters, Variables, Constraints, Expressions, Objective(s)**  
- Recursively save dictionaries, including metadata like units and descriptions  
- Automatically handle uninitialized variables and ensure robust error handling  
- Convert `None`, `ScalarFloat`, and other edge cases for compatibility with HDF5  
- Add metadata and comments to the HDF5 file  
- Built-in **Constraint Tracker** to store selected constraints for tasks like parameter sweeps (e.g. Pareto fronts)
